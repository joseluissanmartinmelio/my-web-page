# José San Martin

Hello, my name is José San Martin, I am an international policy analyst and data scientist. My professional development has been focused on corruption and transparency issues, with more than 2 years of experience as a consultant and data analyst for the Consejo Para La Transparencia.

During my undergraduate and master's studies at the Universidad de Santiago, I developed proficiency in programming languages, particularly Python and R-Rstudio. I have applied these languages to social research, focusing on corruption, ethics, transparency, access to information, and integrity.
